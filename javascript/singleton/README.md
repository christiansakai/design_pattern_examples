# Singleton

Restricts instantiation of a class to a single object. It creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.

Singleton initialization can be delayed.

Singleton serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate implementation code from the global namespace so as to provide a single point of access for functions.
